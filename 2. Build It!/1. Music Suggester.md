## Task
Create a program that is capable of the following:
- Obtaining the users current mood in the form of either a text input, or from a dropdown list of options, and then suggesting them a playlist or song based on their mood!

## Bonus points for the following:
1. Accepts input from a dropdown rather than the user having to type it themselves.
2. Integrate either the Spotify API, or any other music service API.
